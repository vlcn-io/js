# crsqlite-js

JavaScript packages to use `cr-sqlite` in the browser, node, react and other JS frameworks & environments.

# Quickstart

Scaffolding a new project -- https://github.com/vlcn-io/vite-starter/tree/main

Example apps:

- https://github.com/vlcn-io/live-examples
- [Observable Notebook](https://observablehq.com/@tantaman/cr-sqlite-basic-setup)
- [WIP Local-First Presentation Editor](https://github.com/tantaman/strut)

## Browser

```ts
import initWasm from "@vlcn.io/crsqlite-wasm";
import wasmUrl from "@vlcn.io/crsqlite-wasm/crsqlite.wasm?url";

const crsqlite = await initWasm(wasmUrl);
const db = await sqlite.open("db-name");

...

db.close();
```

## NodeJS

```ts
import Database from "better-sqlite3";

const db = new Database(":memory:");
import { extensionPath } from "@vlcn.io/crsqlite";
db.loadExtension(extensionPath);

...

db.close();
```

## React

```ts
function TodoList() {
  const allTodos: readonly Todo[] = useQuery<Todo>(
    ctx,
    "SELECT * FROM todo ORDER BY id DESC"
  ).data;

  return (
    <div>
      {allTodos.map((t) => (
        <Todo item={t} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

# Contributing

If you want to build these projects from source and/or hack on them or contribute, you'll need to clone the workspace repository:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:vlcn-io/workspace.git
```

Running `make` in that directory will get you set up. Ensure you have the rust nightly toolchain installed and activated before running make.
